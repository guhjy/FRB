# Fast and Robust Bootstrap

This package implements the Fast and Robust Bootstrap as proposed in 
[Salibian-Barrera and Zamar (2002)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/aos/1021379865), and
[Salibian-Barrera, M., Van Aels, S. and Willems, G. (2008)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10260-007-0048-6) for robust regression estimators (MM-estimators) as computed with 
`robustbase::lmrob`.
